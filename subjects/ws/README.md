## What is WebSockets?

Lorem ipsum.

## Compatible with HTTP

HTTP Upgrade header.

> The WebSocket Protocol is designed to supersede existing bidirectional
> communication technologies that use HTTP as a transport layer to benefit from
> existing infrastructure (proxies, filtering, authentication).  Such
> technologies were implemented as trade-offs between efficiency and reliability
> because HTTP was not initially meant to be used for bidirectional
> communication (see [RFC6202] for further discussion).  The WebSocket Protocol
> attempts to address the goals of existing bidirectional HTTP technologies in
> the context of the existing HTTP infrastructure; as such, it is designed to
> work over HTTP ports 80 and 443 as well as to support HTTP proxies and
> intermediaries, even if this implies some complexity specific to the current
> environment.  However, the design does not limit WebSocket to HTTP, and future
> implementations could use a simpler handshake over a dedicated port without
> reinventing the entire protocol.  This last point is important because the
> traffic patterns of interactive messaging do not closely match standard HTTP
> traffic and can induce unusual loads on some components.

> The WebSocket Protocol is an independent TCP-based protocol.  Its only
> relationship to HTTP is that its handshake is interpreted by HTTP servers as
> an Upgrade request.

> By default, the WebSocket Protocol uses port 80 for regular WebSocket
> connections and port 443 for WebSocket connections tunneled over Transport
> Layer Security (TLS)

### Protocol handshake

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket#Protocol_handshake

###Â Design philosophy

> The WebSocket Protocol is designed on the principle that there should be
> minimal framing.
>
> Conceptually, WebSocket is really just a layer on top of TCP that does the
> following:
>
> * Adds a web origin-based security model for browsers.
>
> * Adds an addressing and protocol naming mechanism to support multiple
>   services on one port and multiple host names on one IP address.
>
> * Layers a framing mechanism on top of TCP to get back to the IP
>   packet mechanism that TCP is built on, but without length limits.
>
> * Includes an additional closing handshake in-band that is designed to work in
>   the presence of proxies and other intermediaries.
>
> Other than that, WebSocket adds nothing.  Basically it is intended to be as
> close to just exposing raw TCP to script as possible given the constraints of
> the Web.  It's also designed in such a way that its servers can share a port
> with HTTP servers, by having its handshake be a valid HTTP Upgrade request.
>
> https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-1.5

### Message-based

> Once the client and server have both sent their handshakes, and if the
> handshake was successful, then the data transfer part starts. This is a
> two-way communication channel where each side can, independently from the
> other, send data at will.

### Security

> The WebSocket Protocol uses the origin model used by web browsers to restrict
> which web pages can contact a WebSocket server when the WebSocket Protocol is
> used from a web page.  Naturally, when the WebSocket Protocol is used by a
> dedicated client directly (i.e., not from a web page through a web browser),
> the origin model is not useful, as the client can provide any arbitrary origin
> string.
>
> This protocol is intended to fail to establish a connection with servers of
> pre-existing protocols like SMTP [RFC5321] and HTTP, while allowing HTTP
> servers to opt-in to supporting this protocol if desired.  This is achieved by
> having a strict and elaborate handshake and by limiting the data that can be
> inserted into the connection before the handshake is finished (thus limiting
> how much the server can be influenced).
>
> It is similarly intended to fail to establish a connection when data from
> other protocols, especially HTTP, is sent to a WebSocket server.

* Efficient for small messages
* URI schemes (`ws`/`wss`), no fragments
* Subprotocols:

* Fragmentation (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455#section-5.4)
* TCP guarantees order, so WebSockets does also (for one connection)
