## TODO

* command-line interface (cli): what is a command line? why use it? unix emulation on Windows, installation
* copy-paste on Windows
* commands and arguments: pay attention to spaces (escaping)
* getting help (--help)
* avoid spaces and non-ascii characters in directory names
* navigating the filesystem (cd <path>, .., ~, /, auto-completion), Windows filesystem root (/c on Git Bash)
* creating directories with mkdir -p
* PATH, (export PATH="/path/to/bin:$PATH")
* interactive help in commands (press q to quit)
* interrupting running commands (ctrl-c)
* vim basics (some tools automatically open vim: do not panic, command vs insert mode, esc, i, :wq, :q!)
