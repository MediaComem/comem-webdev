# MAS-RAD -- Advanced Front-end Development (DFA)

The goal of this course is to discover concepts and tools to organize the front-end side of a web application and enrich the user interface/experience according to current good practices. You will:

* learn how to make good use of a CSS framework to build a responsive HTML user interface
* learn how to manipulate the DOM API with or without a library
* learn how the use of a framework does help to organize the front-end code of a single page application
* learn how to manage asynchronous communications with a Web API on the back-end

## Citizen engagement

The final deliverable of this course is a complete web application allowing a citizen to report problems encountered in the streets of a city.

This idea is inspired from the [FixMyStreet platform](https://www.fixmystreet.com/) you may know.
