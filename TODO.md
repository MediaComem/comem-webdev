# TODO



## Slides

* JavaScript or Node.js: add a setInterval example to illustrate callback functions
* JavaScript: turn compute function example into an exercise with CodePen
* Git: on the "three states" slides, explain in this order: untracked or modified, staged, then committed
* Git: add a ship loading dock (zone d'embarquement) image to illustrate what the staging area is
* Git branching: show git log after cloning to explain what the state of the project is at the beginning (there are a few existing commits)
* Git branching: create diagrams for the 2 conflict examples at the end
* Collaborating with git: when adding a collaborator on GitHub, do not forget to accept the invitation (sent by e-mail)
* Node: add nested callbacks example (in the form of a question?)
* Node: return in callback example
* npm: add express example at the end
* Heroku: add note on git hooks in "How?" slide
* Express: always send a response (e.g. 500 when error occurs)



## Build

* Rev assets



## Ideas for new subjects

* **npm updating**: how `npm outdated` and `npm update` work, semantic versioning, package.json version syntax
