# TODO

## Slides

* JavaScript or Node.js: add a setInterval example to illustrate callback functions
* Git: on the "three states" slides, explain in this order: untracked or modified, staged, then committed
* Git: add a ship loading dock (zone d'embarquement) image to illustrate what the staging area is
* Git branching: show git log after cloning to explain what the state of the project is at the beginning (there are a few existing commits)
* Git branching: create diagrams for the 2 conflict examples at the end
* Collaborating with git: when adding a collaborator on GitHub, do not forget to accept the invitation (sent by e-mail)

## Build
